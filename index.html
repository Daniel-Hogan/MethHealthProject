    <h1>Hello, Welcome to my Project!</h1>
    <h2>Today I will be teaching you guys about Methamphetamine and its dangers</h2>
    <h3>Created using HTML, CSS, and Github.</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;"> First, What is Methamphetamine and how does it affect your body and brain?</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;"> Methamphetamine is a stimulant drug so it makes the user feel energized and pumped up. 
        It works by creating a large amount of dopamine in the brain and causes the user to become addicted to it.
        It rewires the brain so if the user stops taking meth he or she will start to feel really sick.
        Some short term effects of Meth are more energy, higher body temperature, faster heart rate, faster breathing, and not feeling hungry.
        Some long term effects of Meth are anxiety, confusion, itchy skin, sores, extreme weight loss, and rotting teeth.
